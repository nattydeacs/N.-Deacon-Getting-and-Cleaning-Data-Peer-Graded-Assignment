# N.-Deacon-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Peer-Graded-Assignment
UCI dataset tidying assingment

This is my peer graded assignment for week 4 of the 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course.

The script "run_analysis R: merges the training and the test sets to create one data set, 
extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement,
assigns descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, and
labels the data set with descriptive variable names. Detailed comments are provided in the script 
for each step mentioned. The resulteding datafram is stored in a varibale called "tidydata"

Additionally, the script extracts the mean for each variable, grouping by activity and subject, and writes the
resulting dataframe into a variable called "tidydata2"

Details about the variables can be found in "features_info.txt" in the UCI HAR folder. 
Details about the experiment can be found in the "README.txt" document in the same folder.
